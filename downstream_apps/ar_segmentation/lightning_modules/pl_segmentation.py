"""
Lightning wrapper for AR segmentation.

The template's ``FlareLightningModule`` is already task-agnostic: it calls the model on
the batch, computes ``metrics[...]`` on ``(output, batch["forecast"].unsqueeze(1))`` and
logs. For a (B, H, W) mask that unsqueeze yields (B, 1, H, W), exactly the shape the 1x1
conv and ``HelioSpectformer2D`` produce, so it is reused unchanged under a task-neutral
name. If it ever moves into ``workshop_infrastructure/``, only this import changes.
